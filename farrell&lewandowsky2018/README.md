## Computation Modeling of Cognition and Behavior

### Simon Farrell & Stephan Lewandowsky, 2018

This book is a slightly more advanced and definitely extended version of the Lewandowsky & Farrell, 2012 textbook.

The code from the book is on Simon Farrell's github [here](https://github.com/psy-farrell/computational-modelling). That page also contains a link to the "formal" book website, which contains a related blog.
